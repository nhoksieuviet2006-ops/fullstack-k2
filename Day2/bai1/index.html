      This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking called
      <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the
      food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water path that is
      aprecisele set to the target temperature you wanted to food to be cooked
      to. In his book, Cooking fir Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low
      temperature poaching". <br />
      <br />
      Next month, we will be serving
      <b>Sous vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reverse a seat at the
      chef table, contact us before November 30. <br />
